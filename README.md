# Panel_Data_Hausman_Test_Simulation
Trough a Monte Carlo simulation study I try to investigate the performance under misspecification [Heteroskedasticity(on the individual specific error term and on the remainder error term) and serial correlation] of the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test (and its robust formulation, found in Wooldridge 2002) for correlated effects with panel data.
