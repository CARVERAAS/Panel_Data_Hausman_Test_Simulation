 # Panel Data Hausman Test Monte Carlo Simulation
 Trough a Monte Carlo simulation study I try to investigate the performance under misspecification [Heteroskedasticity(on the individual specific error term and on the remainder error term) and serial correlation] of the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test (and its robust formulation, found in Wooldridge 2002) for correlated effects with panel data.
 ## 1 - DGP of the Variable X
I generate the explanatory variable X as the sum of a between (or crossâ€“sectional or permanent) component $\large \xi_{i}$
